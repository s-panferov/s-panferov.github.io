In this post I just want share a little [gist](https://gist.github.com/s-panferov/c212f75334dc18d6fe25) with you. I contains a very helpful class `ClassManager`. I use it to deal with classes in my project. It helps to build classes in [BEM](https://bem.info/) notation and integrates with ReactJS easily.
